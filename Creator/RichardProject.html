                <p>Experts say that travel will never be the same again after COVID-19. While I believe that COVID-19 will inspire some people to rethink their travel habits, we need more than just talking about adjusting our habits when we can travel again.
                    If we just theorize about “the day after,” no changes are likely to happen. Instead, we need to talk about how to start changing the travel industry right now. This transformation needs a change of heart and mind. For many of us, It
                    feels like our world has shrunk as we are confined in our homes. So, before we talk about how to travel as a peacemaker physically, we should consider how are we traveling now from home.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Williams described how much the conflict in Northern Ireland is intertwined with identity and everyday life. Catholic and Protestant children often don’t understand that the world is bigger than their conflict. As a result, Williams worked
                    to bring Catholic and Protestant children together, in order to break down social barriers between the two communities for future generations. To widen the worldview of the children, one day she brought in a Buddhist monk to give a
                    talk for the children. The monk explained the teachings of Buddhism. The children loved it and ate it up. At the end of the lecture, their hands shot into the air with questions for the Buddhist man. But humorously, one of the first
                    children Williams called on had an unusual question. In an innocently puzzled voice, he asked, “This is so different; this is amazing! But I still don’t understand one thing: are Buddhist monks Catholic or Protestant?”</p>

                <p class="border-para">In some places, COVID-19 has brought people together, but in many other regions in the world, it exacerbated divides. Like the story above, many people have started to view the world in terms of us versus them.
